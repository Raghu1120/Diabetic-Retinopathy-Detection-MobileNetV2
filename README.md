Diabetes causes a disease in the eye known as
diabetic retinopathy. It is when high levels of glucose damage
the blood vessels of the retina. These blood vessels may swell or
be closed and thus prevent blood from flowing through them.
Sometimes, an excess number of new vessels develop on the
retina. All these changes can take away your vision. There are
two main stages of diabetic eye disease: NPDR and PDR. NPDR
is early, featuring leaking blood vessels, swelling, and blurry
eyesight among others. PDR is advanced: which means that
new blood vessels growing cause bleeding, scarring as well as
possible retinal detachment with severe consequences for vision
loss. India has about 77 million people living with diabetes and
this number expectedly is supposed to rise to 125 million by
2045[1].This research explores the application of deep learning
architectures in the binary classification of Diabetic Retinopathy.
Utilizing the 2015 Colored Resized dataset and the Diagnosis
of Diabetic Retinopathy dataset, both available on Kaggle, our
models achieved notable accuracy rates. MobileNetV2 achieved a
highly commendable accuracy of 93.8%, while Xception attained
an accuracy rate of 89.4%.
